GIT - a software that tracks changes in source code and allows for collaboration between multiple people. Works on the local system

GITHUB - Github is an easy to use interface used to manage git repositories. Cloud-based.

Repository - Repositories in github are folders for a project

Clone - Allows you to make a local copy of code, so you can experiment with one version of the code without affecting the original. You can sync the code accordingly. 

Commit - A revision of a file, accompanied by a message explaining what was changed. This allows you to keep track of who makes what changes.

Push - Sending committed changes to a repository. After making edits on a local version, one can commit and push the code onto github

Pull - You "pull" the changes someone else makes and merges it with your code. You can keep updated with the work others have made this way.

Branch - A parallel version of a repository, a copy made to make chan-ges without affecting the live version.

Merge - Takes the changes from one branch and applies it to all others. Typically happens when you request a pull.

Merge Conflict - When two branches have conflicting commits.

Fetch - Allows you to get the latest version from an online repository without merging. Allows you to find the differences between your work and the latest version.

Remote - The version hosted on a server, in this case, github.
